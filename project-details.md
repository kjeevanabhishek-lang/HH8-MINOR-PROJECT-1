## Project Title
Tor Relay Node Setup

## Category
Cyber Security / Privacy Network Lab

## Relay Type
Middle Relay (Safe for home networks)

## Why Middle Relay?
Middle relays only pass encrypted traffic between other Tor nodes.
They do not know the source or destination of traffic, making them safe and ethical for educational use.

## Operating System
Ubuntu Linux

## Security Considerations
- No user traffic inspection
- Bandwidth throttling enabled
- No exit node configuration used
